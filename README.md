# Heroes of Pymoli Data Analysis

[+..••]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GΛMΣ-ӨVΣЯ

## Conclusions
		The Age Demographics show that over half (~58%) of the players are in their twenties. 
		We do not see a large variance in the average purchase price per age group.

		Gender Demographics and the Purchasing Analysis (Gender) show that most of the
		players and income is coming from males. Females did spend slightly more on average,
		but the totals were very different. 

		Top Spenders category shows a small glimpse of how many purchases each player is making.
		I took the mean of the purchase count and found that the players on average make 1.35
		purchases implying people are not always making multiple purchases.
